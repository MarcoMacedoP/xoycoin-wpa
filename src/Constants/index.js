          1. Welcome
          <br /> 1.1 XoyCoin operates a platform accessible through the XoyCoin
          Wallet and website, which is available for download on your mobile
          device that allows users to carry out an manage the XoyCoin Token
          (XOY) transactions. <br />
          2. Warning and advice <br />
          2.1 Dealing or trading with XOY is inherently risky, as the prices of
          XOY can change rapidly. We cannot guarantee that the value of any XOY
          that you purchase will not fall. Therefore, you, while buying or
          selling any XOY, thought the XoyCoin Wallet is at your own risk.{' '}
          <br />
          2.2 The contract wallet that executes your XOY transactions is only
          accessible through a combination of a particular private key and
          public key form your unique identifier on the Ethereum network. (your
          Public and Private Key Pair). The application will generate your
          Public and Private key pair when you downloaded and set up the XoyCoin
          Wallet. <br />
          2.3 Your Public and Private key pair will be paired with and stored on
          the device you download and install the XoyCoin Wallet (your device).
          Therefore, you will need to keep your device safe and secure following
          the best practices recommended by the provider of your operating
          system, such as setting up a secure PIN to prevent unauthorized access
          and ensuring that you keep your software up to date. <br />
          2.4 You are responsible for ensuring that your device is secure. Do
          not use the XoyCoin Wallet on a device that has been "jailbroken,"
          "cracked," "rooted," or otherwise had restrictions in the software
          removed, as this may compromise the security of your public and
          private Key Pair. <br />
          2.5 You can recover your Public and Private Key Pair by using a
          specific "recovery code" (also known as a "Seed," "Seed phrase," or
          "Mnemonic"). The application will generate the code; this code is a
          series of 12 or 2 random words which will be given to you when you
          download and set up the XoyCoin Wallet. <br />
          2.6 You should never give your Public and Private Key Pair or your
          recovery code to any other person, as this will enable them to execute
          transactions using your contract wallet. We will never ask you to
          share the private key or your recovery code with us. We will not be
          responsible for any losses you might suffer from disclosing your
          Public and Private Key Pair or recovery code to another person. <br />
          2.7 If you lose your device or you got your device stolen, you will
          lose access to your Public and Private Key Pair, and you will need to
          recover it by using your unique recovery code (It is essential to
          write this code and store it somewhere safe). <br />
          2.8 Do not store your recovery code on your device. If you lose your
          device and your recovery code, you will not be able to recover your
          Public and Private Key Pair, and you will lose access to your contract
          wallet and XOY stored. We will not be responsible for any losses you
          may suffer if you lose your device or recovery code. <br />
          2.9 Please note that if you delete the XoyCoin Wallet from your device
          or disable the security features on your device, your contract wallet
          will no longer be paired with your device. Therefore, your Public and
          Private Key Pair will 00be removed from your device's storage. To
          recover your Public and Private Key Pair, you will need to use your
          recovery code. We will not be responsible for any losses you might
          suffer due to losing your Public and Private Key Pair if you delete
          the XoyCoin Wallet. <br />
